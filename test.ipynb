    "<p>First one with letter and word drawings, using gen AI as a means of translation for letter and drawing meanings, also focused on accesibility through explination of where/what/how these were acquired.</p>\n",

    "<b>Questions</b>\n",
    "<li>What is the object? In particular, can you find out any information about its origin, history or use?</li>\n",
    "<p>The object is refered to as as, 'Illuminations on vellum: capital letters, ornaments.' It is also simply referred to as a volume of initial letters manuscript.</p>\n",
    "<p>From the UofG Collections Page, I found that it was extracted from a 14th century Carmelite missal. It use, while not entirely clear, its extensive representation of different lettering may encourage many forms of creativity to develop alongside it.</p>\n",
    "<li>What is the value of the object? What distinguishes it, why is it interesting, and/or who would it be of interest to?</li>\n",
    "<p>The objects value could be derived from how old it is - assumed to be at least from the 14th century. As well as this the object can be traced from an imperfect missal, which would hold many high value collections at this time.</p>\n",
    "<p>It is distinguished by its noticebale oatterns on its cover, as well as its easily recognisable patterns inside it. Its deep colours and small, detailed designs would be of interest to designers, artists, and language students.</p>\n",
    "<li>Are there other known objects that are similar or are related to the object by context, history or origin?</li>\n",
    "<p>According to UofG Collections, two volumes (as a part of a larger election of this) was sold in 1833 of which is owned today by The British Library Department of Manuscripts.</p>\n",
    "<li>What collection is it part of? Where is it stored?</li>\n",
    "<p>This object is stored in the UofG Archives and Special Collections Department, in its manuscripts collections. Its reference code is GB 247 MS Euing 26, and is available to examine the outside of it through the UofG collections website. Physical access is available through appointment.</p>"
